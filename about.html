            <p class="par">Tourism is the act of traveling to a place for pleasure or business purposes.<br>
                 It is a significant contributor to the economy of many countries, including Spain. 
                 Spain is a country located in southwestern Europe,<br> and it is the second-largest country in the European Union and<br>
                  the fourth-most populous EU member state.<br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                 Spain’s capital and largest city is Madrid; other major urban areas include Barcelona,<br> Valencia, Seville, Zaragoza, Málaga, Murcia,<br> Palma de Mallorca, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, and Bilbao 1. Valencia is a city worth visiting in Spain.<br> It has a charming old town next to futuristic buildings.<br>
                 The city has a vibrant old center with a knot of little streets<br>
                  <br>and splendid medieval buildings like the UNESCO-listed Lonja de la Seda.<br>
                  Tourism can have both positive and negative impacts.<br>
                   On the positive side, it promotes cultural exchange,<br>
                   fosters economic growth, and contributes to the preservation of natural and cultural heritage.<br>
                    It also provides opportunities for personal growth, education, and relaxation.<br>
                     However, tourism can also have negative effects on the environment, local communities,<br>
                      and cultural integrity if not managed properly.<br>
                   Issues such as overtourism, environmental degradation,<br> 
                   and cultural commodification require careful planning and sustainable practices.<br>
                  The tourism industry has been greatly affected by various factors,<br>
                   including global events such as natural disasters,<br>
                   political instability,<br>
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   and pandemics like the COVID-19 outbreak. Travel restrictions,<br>
                    lockdowns, and health concerns have significantly impacted the tourism sector worldwide.<br>
                    However, as vaccinations become more widespread and travel restrictions are lifted,<br>
                     the industry is gradually recovering,
                   although it may take time to return to pre-pandemic levels.<br>
                  When planning a trip, it is important to consider factors such as destination selection,<br>
                   transportation, accommodation, travel insurance, and local customs and regulations.<br>
                    Many people use travel agencies, online platforms,<br> 
                    and resources to assist them in organizing their trips and ensure a smooth travel experience.<br>
                     Overall, tourism is a dynamic and evolving industry that provides opportunities<br>
                   for individuals to explore new places,<br>
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   experience different cultures, and contribute to local economies.<br>
                   Tourism is the activity of traveling to different places for pleasure, leisure, <br>
                   and exploration. It involves visiting various destinations,<br>
                    experiencing their attractions, and engaging in recreational activities. <br>
                    Tourism can be domestic, where people travel within their own country, <br>
                    or international, where individuals travel to other countries.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                   <br>
                    <br>
                   <br>
                   Tourism plays a significant role in the global economy, as it generates revenue, <br>
                   creates job opportunities, and promotes cultural exchange. It encompasses a wide range<br>
                    of activities, including sightseeing, visiting historical and cultural landmarks,<br>
                     participating in adventure sports, enjoying nature and wildlife, and experiencing local cuisine<br>
                      and traditions.</p>
